# TODO

- [x] finish windows implementation
- [x] finish darwin implementation
- [ ] add more desktop envs to linux implementation (currently only feh and gnome are supported)
- [x] update setup.py for os specific setups - we dont need every setup to have all of the libraries for all the operating systems - just one 
- [] (feature idea) make startup scripts for different operating system and add it as an option for easy startup program implementation
